<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>CCNx utilizes Time values for a number of functions. Some of these are expressed as absolute time, others as delta time. When using CCNx in environments with constrained nodes and/or bandwidth constrained networks, it is valuable to have a compact representation of time values. For example <xref target="I-D.irtf-icnrg-icnlowpan"/> specifies a compression scheme useful over IEEE 804.15.4 networks. However, any compact time representation has to sacrifice either accuracy or dynamic range or both. For some time uses this is relatively straightforward to achieve, for other uses, it is not. This document discusses the various cases, and proposes a compact encoding that is easily accommodated for delta times, and a more complicated method that can be considered for some uses of absolute time.</t>
</section>

<section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
</section>
<section title="Usage of Time values CCNx">
<section anchor="relativeTime" title="Relative Time usage in CCNx">

<t>CCNx, as currently specified in <xref target="RFC8569"/>, utilizes delta time for only the lifetime of an Interest message (sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.4.2, 10.3). It is a hop-by-hop header value, and is currently encoded via the T_INTLIFE TLV as a 64-bit integer (<xref target="RFC8609"/> section 3.4.1). While formally an optional TLV, in all but some corner cases every Interest Message is expected to carry the Interest Lifetime TLV, and hence having compact encoding is particularly valuable for keeping Interest messages short.</t>

<t>Since the current uses of delta time do not require both accuracy and dynamic range simultaneously, one can consider a logarithmic encoding such as that specified in <xref target="RFC5497"/> and outlined in <xref target="sec.timetlv"/>. This document updates CCNx messages in TLV Format (<xref target="RFC8609"/>) to permit this alternative encoding for selected Time values. See <xref target="IANA"/> for the specific actions needed to register this alternative compact representation of Interest Lifetime.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="absoluteTime" title="Absolute Time usage in CCNx">
<t>CCNx, as currently specified in <xref target="RFC8569"/>, utilizes absolute time for various important functions. Each of these absolute time usages poses a different challenge for a compact representation. These are discussed in the following subsections.</t>

<section title="Signature Time">
<t><spanx>Signature Time</spanx> is the time the signature of a content object was generated (<xref target="RFC8569">sections 8.2-8.4</xref>). This is a content message TLV stating the time the signature on the content object was generated, in milliseconds since the UTC epoch (i.e. An NTP timestamp). It is currently encoded via the T_SIGTIME TLV as a 64-bit unsigned integer (see <xref target="RFC8609"> section 3.6.4.1.4.5</xref>).</t>	

<t>Given that a signature time could be essentially at any time in the past, and is included in the hash securing the content object, it seems there is no practical way to define an alternative compact encoding that preserves its semantics and security properties; hence we don't consider it further as a candidate.</t>
</section>

<section title="Expiry Time">
<t><spanx>Expiry Time</spanx> indicates the expiry time of a content object (<xref target="RFC8569">section 4</xref>). This is a content message TLV (covered by the hash and signature of the content object) stating the expiration time of the content object in milliseconds since the UTC epoch (i.e. An NTP timestamp). It is currently encoded via the T_EXPIRY TLV as a 64-bit unsigned integer (see <xref target="RFC8609"> section 3.6.2.2.2</xref>).</t>

<t>Expiry time could be in the past, or in the future, potentially by a large delta, and is included in the hash securing the content object. Therefore, it seems there is no practical way to define an alternative compact encoding that preserves its semantics and security properties; hence we don't consider it further as a candidate.</t>
</section>

<section title="Recommended Cache Time">
<t><spanx>Recommended Cache Time</spanx> (RCT) for a content object (<xref target="RFC8569">see section 4</xref>) is a hop-by-hop header stating the expiration time for a cached content object in milliseconds since the UTC epoch (i.e. An NTP timestamp). It is currently encoded via the T_CACHETIME TLV as a 64-bit unsigned integer (see <xref target="RFC8609"> section 3.4.2</xref>).</t>

<t>Recommended cache time could be far in the future, but cannot be in the past and is likely to be a reasonably short offset from the current time. Therefore, there are a couple of alternatives for defining a compact representation. These are:
<list style="symbols">
<t>allow the compact representation to be interpreted as a delta time rather than an absolute time, since the semantics associated with an absolute time value do not seem to be critical to the utility of this value.</t>
<t>define an alternative absolute time base against which the RCT delta can be measured. One potential candidate would be a <spanx>message generation time</spanx> included as a message TLV (not a hop-by-hop TLV). While doing this would not save any space if used for just RCT (it would actually make the message bigger) if its cost could be amortitized across multiple other time TLVs in the same message, it might be a win.</t>
</list>
This possibility is for further analysis and discussion as the document progresses.

<section title="A Compact Time Representation with Logarithmic Range" anchor="sec.timetlv">
  <t>
    This document defines a compact time representation with logarithmic range support that is inspired by <xref target="RFC5497"/>.
    Compact time-codes are one or two octets wide and represent time-values that range from milliseconds to days.
    <xref target="fig.time-value"/> depicts the logarithmic nature of this time representation.

<section title="Alternatives for a compact time representation in CCNx messages">

<t>A straightforward way to accommodate the TimeTLV approach as an alternative encoding is to simply allow a 1 or 2-byte length as an alternative to the 8-byte length while retaining the existing TLV Registry entries. While this has backward compatibility problems, the authors recommend this approach for the following reasons:
<list style="symbols">
	<t>Both CCNx RFCs are experimental and not Standards Track, hence expectations for forward and backward compatibility are not as stringent. "Flag day" upgrades of deployed CCNx networks, while inconvenient, are still feasible.</t>
	<t>The major use case for these compressed encodings are smaller-scale IoT and/or sensor networks where the population of consumers, producers, and forwarders is reasonably small.</t>
	<t>Since the current TLVs have hop-by-hop semantics, they are not covered by any signed hash and hence may be freely re-encoded by any forwarder. That means a forwarder supporting the new encoding can translate freely between the two encodings.</t>
	<t>The alternative of assigning new TLV registry values does not substantially mitigate the interoperability problems anyway.</t>
</list>
